Introduction
============

This package aims to bridge the gap for SAS users transitioning to Python
by providing familiar procedure interfaces, optimized for Pandas and PySpark.

Currently implemented procedures:

* :py:func:`~sas2spark.proc_freq`: Frequency analysis.

Future procedures may include mimics of PROC MEANS, PROC SORT, etc.
